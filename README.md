# 🧬 Bioinformatics-Biopython-Pipeline  

An interactive **command-line toolkit** for analyzing DNA sequences directly from **NCBI nucleotide accession IDs**.  
Instead of manually downloading sequences, simply enter an ID, and the toolkit retrieves and processes the data automatically.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
- 📄 **Show sequence (FASTA format):** Fetch and display DNA sequences from NCBI.  
- 🔢 **Count ATGC bases:** Compute total and per-base nucleotide counts.  
- 🧪 **Translate DNA to protein (CDS-aware):** Convert coding regions into amino acid sequences.  
- 🔗 **Align two sequences:** Perform pairwise sequence alignment using NCBI IDs.  
- 📊 **Visualize GC & ORF maps:** Generate plots of GC content and predicted open reading frames.  
- 🔍 **Run BLAST:** Compare sequences against databases using BLAST.  
- 📖 **Annotate genome:** Save annotated records in GenBank format.  

---

## 💡 Why Use It?  
This toolkit is designed for:  
- 🧑‍🎓 **Students** – learn bioinformatics hands-on.  
- 🔬 **Researchers** – quickly analyze sequences without setup hassle.  
- 👨‍💻 **Hobbyists** – explore DNA with an easy-to-use menu-driven tool.  

By working directly with **NCBI accession IDs**, it removes the hassle of manually downloading and managing FASTA files.

## ⚙️ Example Workflow  
1. Enter an NCBI nucleotide ID (e.g., `NM_001005484.2`).  
2. Choose an option from the interactive menu:  
   - Display the sequence in FASTA  
   - Count nucleotide composition  
   - Translate coding regions to proteins  
   - Align two sequences by ID  
   - Generate GC/ORF visualization  
   - Run BLAST for similarity search  
   - Save annotated sequence in GenBank format

## 📌 Applications  
- Quick exploration of genes and coding regions  
- Visualizing genomic features  
- Preparing sequences for further downstream analysis  
- Teaching or learning **basic bioinformatics**
